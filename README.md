# Google HA VPN example
This repository provides a basic example of a High Availability (HA) VPN setup between two VPCs located in separate Google Cloud projects. While VPC peering would typically be a more cost-effective solution in this scenario, this example is meant to demonstrate the fundamentals of HA VPN configuration.

It includes:
- 2 VPCs  
- 2 Cloud VPN gateways  
- 4 gateway interfaces  
- 4 VPN tunnels with BGP peering
